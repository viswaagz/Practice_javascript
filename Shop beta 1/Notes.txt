To dry a shirt quickly, gently wring out excess water and lay it flat on a clean towel. Roll the towel with the shirt inside and press to absorb moisture. Hang the shirt in a well-ventilated area or near a fan to speed up drying. Avoid direct sunlight to prevent fading.

Stitching is the foundation of every garment, ensuring durability and structure. It binds fabric together, creating a flawless fit and enhancing comfort. Well-executed stitching adds longevity to clothes, making them withstand daily wear and tear.

Accurate measurement is key to achieving the perfect fit in any garment. It ensures that the clothing complements your body shape, enhancing comfort and style. Without precise measurements, even the finest fabric can result in a poor fit.
